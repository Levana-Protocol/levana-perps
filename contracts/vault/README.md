# Levana Perps - vault contract

Liquidity pools within Levana Perps are segregated between markets to avoid contagion risk. However, in many cases, liquidity providers would like to receive passive returns without managing their individual positions closely. This contract allows a liquidity provider to deposit liquidity into a single contract to be redistributed throughout markets as needed.
