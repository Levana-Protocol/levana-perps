# Levana Perps - countertrade contract

This contract performs a basic countertrade trading strategy. It allows permissionless deposit of funds to be used for opening unpopular positions on markets. Unpopular positions will receive funding payments. This is a risky, non-delta-neutral strategy, as it still exposes users to price exposure.
